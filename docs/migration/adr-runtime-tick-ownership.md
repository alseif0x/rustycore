# ADR — Live-runtime tick ownership and convergence

**Date:** 2026-05-29 · **Status:** Accepted · **Base commit:** `6671dee`

This ADR fixes a clean starting point for converging RustyCore onto a real live
runtime. It supersedes stale runtime claims in `MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` / `_INDEX.md`
(their L3 status snapshots predate the canonical map work and have drifted).

## Context (verified)

Three world models coexist today (characterized + regression-anchored in
`#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.764`):

1. **Legacy `wow_world::MapManager`** (`Arc<RwLock<…>>`, `crates/world-server/src/main.rs`).
   Shared across sessions. Runs creature **AI/combat** via per-session ticks
   (`tick_creatures_sync`, `tick_combat_sync` in `crates/wow-world/src/session.rs`).
   **No clock of its own** — advances only when a logged-in session ticks it.
2. **Canonical `wow_map::MapManager`** (`crates/wow-map/src/manager.rs`).
   Owns the global tick loop (`spawn_canonical_map_update_loop`, ~10ms) and a faithful
   `Map::Update` phase structure, but its creature update uses
   `CreatureRuntimeUpdateContext::default()` and **does not dispatch real AI/combat**
   (no `match` executes `AiUpdateTick`/`MeleeAttackIfReady`).
3. **Global world loop** — ticks only the canonical manager (2), never the legacy (1).

The old `WorldSession.creatures: HashMap` field no longer exists; do not build on it.

### C++ structural truth (verified against legacy)

- `World::Update` → `sMapMgr->Update(diff)` — `World.cpp:2748`.
- `Map::Update(t_diff)` — `Map.cpp:666` — runs, in order:
  1. `_dynamicTree.update`
  2. **worldsessions for existing players** (`session->Update(t_diff, updater)`)
  3. **respawns** (`ProcessRespawns`, `UpdateSpawnGroupConditions`)
  4. **`Trinity::ObjectUpdater`** over active cells — this is where creatures/pets/active
     objects update (AI/combat)
  5. then `SendObjectUpdates`, scripts, weather, move-list drains, relocation notifies.

So in C++ the **global map tick owns the creature/AI/combat update**, and player
sessions are updated as an **earlier phase of the same map tick** — not the other way
around. The Rust legacy model (each session owns creature AI/combat) is **structurally
inverted** from C++. The canonical `wow_map::MapManager` already mirrors the C++
`Map::Update` phase order, so it is the correct **structural destination**.

## Decision

1. **Single tick-owner invariant.** A creature/combat tick is owned by exactly one of:
   the session OR the global runtime — **never both**. The deadly bug to avoid is a global
   tick that *adds to* the per-session tick (double resolution). Introduce an explicit
   owner (e.g. `RuntimeTickOwner::{ Session, GlobalLegacy }`).
2. **Legacy is the transitional behavior engine; canonical is the structural destination.**
   Do not consolidate everything onto `wow_map::MapManager` at once (it has the clock and
   structure but not real AI/combat — porting that surface in one shot repeats the `_attic/`
   big-bang that died with 176 compile errors). Keep legacy running the behavior, move it
   under a global clock, then migrate the source of truth method-by-method.
3. **Migrate ownership/fanout before logic.** Get "who ticks" and "who sends packets to which
   sessions" right before moving gameplay resolution.
4. **Track separation.** `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.*` is the represented-logic mini-phase. The live
   runtime convergence is **L3/L4 of `MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md`** and must use roadmap
   phase/module IDs, not the `R8.ENTITIES` namespace.

## Refined sequence (supersedes the earlier handoff roadmap order)

1. ✅ Characterize the split — `#NEXT.R8.ENTITIES.764` (tests only).
2. **This ADR** — clean starting point; minimal reconciliation of roadmap/_INDEX drift.
3. **Infra, no behavior change:** add the `RuntimeTickOwner` guard; extract the bodies of
   `tick_creatures_sync`/`tick_combat_sync` into reusable helpers driven by a
   `PacketSink`/`RuntimeOutput`, callable by either a session or the global runtime. Default
   stays `Session`. Add a regression test proving a creature is ticked **once** with two
   sessions on the same map.
4. **First behavior change:** global legacy tick owner with session creature/combat ticks
   **disabled** for that responsibility (NOT global tick in addition to session tick).
5. Per-map session registry + creature-move/object-update fanout from the global tick.
6. Move combat resolution to the global owner (resolve once, not per session).
7. Migrate the source of truth toward `wow_map::MapManager`, method by method; retire legacy.
8. Real `SendObjectUpdates`, scripts, weather, threat, remaining fanout.

## Risks to respect

- **Double resolution** — two sessions on one map advancing the same state twice. Mitigated by
  the single-owner invariant (step 3) before any global behavior tick (step 4).
- **C++ phase order** — the global tick must respect `Map::Update`'s phase sequence
  (sessions → respawns → ObjectUpdater → SendObjectUpdates → scripts/weather/relocation), not
  an ad-hoc order.
- **No packets under map lock** — the global tick must not send session packets while holding a
  map `RwLock`/`Mutex`. Build packet plans inside the lock, send outside it.
- **Locks in Tokio** — `std::sync::RwLock`/`Mutex` are acceptable only for short sections with
  no `.await`. Heavy simulation belongs on a dedicated task/thread or computes plans outside
  the lock.
- **Single source of truth** — while legacy and canonical coexist, every mutation needs a single
  owner or explicit sync.
- **Backpressure** — a full session channel must not block the global tick under a lock.
- **Unload / active grids** — C++ does not update everything always; it respects maps, loaded
  grids, players, and active non-players. Do not globally tick idle/unloaded content.

## Consequences

- The next production slice is **infrastructure** (`RuntimeTickOwner` + extract-to-helper, no
  behavior change), not gameplay.
- Progress metric note: this convergence advances the live-runtime axis (~0% today, per
  `honest-progress-audit.md`), not the `R8.ENTITIES` inventory count.
